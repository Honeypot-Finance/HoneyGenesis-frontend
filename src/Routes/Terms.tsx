          <h1>NFT Terms of Sale to Users</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome, and thank you for your interest in non-fungible tokens
            (“NFTs”) sold by Honeypot Finance (“Honeypot,” “we,” or “us”). These
            NFT Terms of Sale to Users (“NFT Terms”) are a legally binding
            contract between you and Honeypot regarding your use of the NFTs.
          </p>
          <h2>1.Buying & Selling. </h2>
          <p>
            Honeypot may make NFTs available for purchase. Subject to these NFT
            Terms, you may resell NFTs, provided that any subsequent purchase of
            NFTs (“Secondary Sale”) will also be subject to these NFT Terms.
            Immediately following any Secondary Sale, you will no longer have
            any rights to the NFT, and any associated licenses or other rights
            provided under these NFT Terms or by Honeypot will terminate.
          </p>
          <h2>2.NFT License. </h2>
          <p>
            Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these NFT
            Terms, Honeypot grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
            non-transferable (except in connection with a Secondary Sale),
            non-sublicensable, revocable license under (i) all copyrights,
            copyright applications, copyright registrations, or other
            intellectual property rights owned by you in the purchased NFTs or
            the artwork represented by the purchased NFT (clause (i) the “NFT
            IP”); and (ii) any publicity waivers or rights therein signed by any
            persons appearing in the purchased NFT, to (a) resell any NFT you
            purchase, and (b) use the NFT IP (x) for your own personal,
            non-commercial use (for example home display, display in a virtual
            gallery or as an avatar); (y) as part of a marketplace that permits
            the purchase and sale of your NFTs, provided that the marketplace
            cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the
            NFT IP for their NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can
            display the NFT IP; or (z) as part of a third party website or
            application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
            participation of your NFTs, provided that the website/application
            cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the
            NFT for their NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display
            the NFT IP, and provided that the NFT IP is no longer visible once
            the owner of the NFT leaves the website/application. The license to
            display the NFT IP for the purchased NFT is automatically and always
            transferred with the NFT as provided above in Section 1. Otherwise
            the license to display the NFT IP for the purchased NFT is
            non-transferable. For clarity, except for the foregoing license,
            neither your purchase of an NFT nor these NFT Terms grant you any
            other license or rights to any NFT or NFT IP.
          </p>
          <h2>3.License and Use Restrictions. </h2>
          <p>
            Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible
            under applicable law, you agree that you will not: 3.1 Profit from,
            otherwise commercialize, or license the NFT or NFT IP, including in
            connection with the marketing, advertising, or selling of any third
            party product, except as part of a Secondary Sale; 3.2 Engage in
            price manipulation, fraud, or other deceptive, misleading, or
            manipulative activity with respect to the NFTs; 3.3 Modify the NFT
            or NFT IP in any way or combine the NFT or NFT IP with, or embed the
            NFT or NFT IP into, any digital or other content or media (for
            avoidance of doubt, this does not restrict you from using the NFT
            image as your profile picture or avatar so long as you own the NFT,
            but you may not modify or change the image); 3.4 Use the NFT or NFT
            IP in any manner which infringes upon the intellectual property
            rights of any person or entity; 3.5 Use the NFT in connection with
            or to promote any illegal activity, hate speech, violence,
            inappropriate or obscene content, or in any other manner which could
            tarnish or harm the reputation of Honeypot and its affiliates, or
            any third-party whose name, brand, image, or likeness is represented
            by the NFT; 3.6 Encourage or permit any third party to do any of the
            foregoing.
          </p>
          <h2>Valuation of Products and Assumption of Risk.</h2>
          <p>
            The prices and value of NFTs are volatile and subjective. NFTs and
            similar digital assets have no inherent or intrinsic value and may
            have no use. Honeypot does not and cannot guarantee that any NFTs
            purchased or acquired by you will retain their original value or
            have any particular value. You acknowledge that to the extent any
            NFT has value, any NFT may drop in value for many reasons and
            Honeypot will have no responsibility for determining value or making
            up any loses in value to you and Honeypot is not required to
            repurchase any NFTs for any reason. You agree to assume all risk
            associated with the use and value of NFTs. You also agree not to use
            the NFTs in any way that would violate applicable laws, including US
            securities laws.
          </p>
          <h2>5.No Investment Advice.</h2>
          <p>
            Honeypot does not provide investment, tax, or legal advice, nor does
            Honeypot broker NFT trades or trading in any other assets on your
            behalf. All transfers of NFTs or any other assets are based on the
            parameters of your instructions, and you are solely responsible for
            determining whether any NFT purchase, investment strategy or related
            transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment
            objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should
            consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific
            situation. The information provided by Honeypot or through any of
            Honeypot's third-party service providers does not constitute
            investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other
            sort of advice, and you should not treat any such content as such.
            Honeypot does not recommend that any NFTs, or any other assets,
            should be bought, earned, sold, or held by you. Before making the
            decision to buy, sell or hold any NFTs, you should conduct your own
            due diligence and consult your financial advisors before making any
            investment decision. Honeypot will not be held responsible for the
            decisions you make to buy, sell, or hold NFTs or any other assets.
          </p>
          <h2>6.NFT DISCLAIMERS. </h2>
          <p>
            NFTS ARE INTANGIBLE VIRTUAL ASSETS THAT EXIST BY VIRTUE OF THE
            OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN AND/OR MAINTAINED BY
            HONEYPOT IN A PRIVATE LEDGER OR DATABASE. HONEYPOT AND ITS
            THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE NO PROMISES OR GUARANTEES WITH
            RESPECT TO ANY BLOCKCHAIN OR SMART CONTRACTS. YOU AGREE THAT
            HONEYPOT AND ITS THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
            FOR AND WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ISSUES OR LOSSES RELATED TO
            ANY BLOCKCHAIN, ANY DIGITAL WALLETS, OR SMART CONTRACTS.
          </p>
          <h2>7.Regulatory Disclaimers. </h2>
          <p>
            The laws and regulations governing non-fungible tokens, blockchain
            technologies, and cryptocurrencies are rapidly evolving. Changes in
            such laws or regulations may impact our ability to provide NFTs.
          </p>
          <h2>8. Miscellaneous</h2>
          <h3>8.1 General Terms.</h3>
          <p>
            You may not assign or transfer these NFT Terms or your rights under
            these NFT Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
            otherwise, without our prior written consent except as expressly
            provided herein. We may assign these NFT Terms and all rights
            granted under these NFT Terms at any time without notice or consent.
            The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect
            our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor
            will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these NFT Terms, or
            any provision of these NFT Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent
            breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of
            Section headers in these NFT Terms is for convenience only and will
            not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.
            Throughout these NFT Terms the use of the word “including” means
            “including but not limited to.” If any part of these NFT Terms is
            held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part
            will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the
            remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
          </p>
          <h3>8.2 Governing Law</h3>
          <p>
            These NFT Terms are governed by the laws of the Marshall Islands
            without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Honeypot
            submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
            courts and federal courts located within the Marshall Islands for
            resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these
            NFT Terms.
          </p>
          <h3>8.3 Amendment.</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            We reserve the right to amend these NFT Terms from time to time in
            our absolute discretion. Amendments will be effective as soon as
            such changes are notified to you in writing from time to time.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>8.4 Precedence</h3>
          <p>
            Where there is inconsistency between these NFT Terms and other
            content displayed as part of the Honeypot Finance platform
            concerning the sale of NFTs, the content of these NFT Terms will
            prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.
          </p>
          <h3>8.5 Force Majeure.</h3>
          <p>
            We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform our
            obligations under these NFT Terms if such delay is due to any
            circumstances beyond our reasonable control (including but not
            limited to epidemics, pandemics, blockchain congestion or attacks,
            Government sanctions or orders, whether known or unknown at the time
            the parties enter into these NFT Terms) (Force Majeure Event).
          </p>
          <h3>8.6 Waiver. </h3>
          <p>
            A provision of these NFT Terms or a right created under it may not
            be waived except in writing signed by the party granting the waiver.
          </p>
          <h3>8.7 Assignment.</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            (a) These NFT Terms are for the benefit of the parties and their
            successors and assigns. The parties and their successors and assigns
            are bound by these NFT Terms. (b) To the extent that any party
            purchases an NFT from you, they are deemed to have taken an
            assignment of these NFT Terms as published at the time of the
            purchase and you must provide that party with a link or copy of
            these NFT Terms. (c) We may assign our rights under these NFT Terms
            without your consent, including at any time.
          </p>
          <h3>8.8 Severance. </h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            If any provision of these NFT Terms are void, voidable,
            unenforceable, illegal, prohibited or otherwise invalid in a
            jurisdiction, in that jurisdiction the provision must be read down
            to the extent it can be to save it but if it cannot be saved by
            reading it down, words must be severed from the provision to the
            extent they can be to save it but if that also fails to save it the
            whole provision must be severed. That will not invalidate the
            remaining provisions of these NFT Terms nor affect the validity or
            enforceability of that provision in any other jurisdiction where it
            is not invalid.

            in respect of the subject matter of these NFT Terms and supersedes
            all prior discussions, representations, undertakings and agreements.
            (b) None of our agents or representatives are authorised to make any
            representations, conditions or agreements not expressed by us in
